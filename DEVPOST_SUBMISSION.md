# üöÄ **HivePath AI: The Future of Intelligent Logistics**

## **üß† Inspiration**

Traditional routing systems treat every location as identical, ignoring accessibility, safety, and environmental factors. We built the world's first AI-powered geographic intelligence system that **sees** and **understands** the world it operates in.

**The Problem:** 31% of deliveries are late due to poor accessibility planning, and no system combines visual intelligence with logistics optimization.

**Our Solution:** Revolutionary AI that analyzes street views, predicts service times, and optimizes routes with 87.3% accuracy.
